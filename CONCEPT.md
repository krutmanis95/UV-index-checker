## Project Description
Our app shows current and 5 hour forecast UV index at your inputed location. Location is defined by longtitude and latitude. Addionally we may add also sunrise and sunset times at inputed location. Based on current UV index suggest recommendations to user. User is prompted to allow input their current location data to get required lontitude and latitude.

## Problem Statement
It is important to know the UV index because it shows the intensity of ultraviolet radiation from the sun and helps us understand the risk of sunburn and skin damage. Knowing the UV index allows people to take proper protective measures, such as using sunscreen or seeking shade. This helps protect health and reduces the long-term risk of skin cancer.
